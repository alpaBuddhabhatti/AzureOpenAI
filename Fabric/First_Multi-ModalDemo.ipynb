Embeddings\n- **Embedding Generation**: These smaller chunks are converted into embeddings using a model (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT-4).\n\n### 5. Vector Store\n- **Vector Database**: The embeddings are stored in a vector database. This database is optimized for searching and retrieving relevant chunks of information.\n\n### 6. Prompt & Search\n- **User Interaction**: The user inputs a question.\n- **Search**: The system searches the vector database for relevant chunks of information.\n- **Relevant Chunks**: The relevant chunks are retrieved from the vector database.\n\n### 7. Generation\n- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: The relevant chunks are sent to the large language model (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT-4), along with a predefined system prompt.\n- **Answer Generation**: The LLM processes the information and generates an answer to the user's question.\n\n### Summary\n- **Data Gathering**: Collecting data from various sources.\n- **Data Extraction**: Extracting usable information.\n- **Splitting Chunks**: Dividing data into smaller pieces.\n- **Embeddings**: Converting chunks into embeddings.\n- **Vector Store**: Storing embeddings in a vector database.\n- **Prompt & Search**: User queries and searches the database.\n- **Generation**: LLM generates answers based on retrieved data.\n\nThis process allows for efficient retrieval and generation of information, enhancing the capabilities of the language model by augmenting it with a vast and searchable knowledge base.\n"]}],"execution_count":20,"metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false,"source_hidden":false},"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"},"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}}},"id":"37f573d2-6f25-419f-bb7b-3c5c181bfc32"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Example 3:** The image has barcode details.
